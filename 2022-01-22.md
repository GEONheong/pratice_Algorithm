## 695. Max Area of Island (Medium)
[https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/)

> We’re given an M x N binary matrix grid such as this picture (Fig. 1).<br>
Imagine it 0 is the sea and 1 is the island, such as the island on the sea.<br>
The goal is figure out the biggest island out of all islands.

**Fig. 1**

# 코드설명

**Blod – variable**
1) Get the size of the grid at line:3,4
2) Define the global variable maxArea and count at line:6,7
    1. The maxArea has the biggest island of size until now.
    2. The count has (?)(현재 크기를 구하고 있는 섬의 크기를 담는 변수)(sizing the island of the current coordinate)
3) Define a function named dsf at line:9~30
    1. if the current coordinate value is 1, change it to 2 (it means visited this coordinate). Line: 11,12
    2. And check the coordinate in a 4way direction at line:13~28
4) Using a nested for-loop, search the island and then figure out the biggest island at line:32~41
    1. The current coordinate value is 1, increase count 1(The reason is current location also land.) line:35
    2. Find out the size of the island of the current location. line:36
    3. And compare with the current island of count and maxArea. line:37~41
