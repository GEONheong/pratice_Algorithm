## 733. Flood Fill (Easy)
[https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/)

> We’re given a m x n grid ,the coordinates (sr,sc) and number called “newColor”. The goal is to perform a **flood fill** on the grid starting from the coordinates (sr,sc) with “newColor”.

# 코드설명
1. Find the size of the grid at line:3,4
2. If starting coordinate color(=number,oldColor) is same as newColor return right now. line :5,6
3. Implemented DFS using recursive at line:9~19
	1. If the current coordinate color is the same as oldColor. Change to newColor.
	2. And perform a recursive in 4-way focused on current coordinate.
