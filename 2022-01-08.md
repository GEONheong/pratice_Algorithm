## 19. Remove the/a Nth Node From the End of a List (Medium)
[https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list)

> We’re given a linked list and a number N. The goal is to delete the node n-th to the end of the linked list.

# 코드설명
**bold - variable**
1. Append the **head** node right before the first node at line:12.
2. Get the **length** of the linked list using a while loop at lines:15-19
    1. Make a pointer **p**. The **p** points to the first node at line:16
    2. if it has **next** of the node pointed by pointer **p**, increase the **length** by 1 and move the pointer p to the next node at line:17-19
    3. if it does not have **next**, this is the last node
3. Find Nth node to remove at line:22-26
    1. Reuse the pointer **p**. It points to the first node now at line:22
    2. Make a pointer called **last**. It points to the head node at line:23 (**last** is a reference variable. Therefore, if the **last** is modified, the **head** is also modified.)
    3. Loop/iterate for **length - n** times, because we want to find the Nth node from the end of the linked list.
    4. move the **last** pointer to where pointer **p** was located and pointer **p** move to the next node at line:24-26
4. Finally, when all processing is done. Pointer **p** is located in having to remove the node. So, change the **next** value of the **last** pointer to the **next** value of pointer **p**.

# 복잡도
time: O(n) <br>
The reason (why time complexity is O(n),) this solution uses a for-loop that runs/iterates n times at line: 24 and other lines have constant complexity.
