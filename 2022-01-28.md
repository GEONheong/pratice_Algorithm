## 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node (Medium)
[https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/)

> You are given a **perfect binary tree.** You perform each node points to the next right node in the same level. If there is no next right node, the current node should point to “NULL”

> **Perfect Binary Tree:** All nodes are on the same level and every parent has two children.

>I used `DFS(Depth-First Search)` algorithm to solve this problem.<br>
`DFS` algorithm requires a stack data structure. So, we use a recursive function. It performs like a stack structure. 


# 코드설명

**bold - variable**
1. If the tree does not have a root node or child, return the root at line:14,15
2. If the current node has children. Line:17
    1. Make the left child node point to the next right node. Line:18
    2. If the current node does not point to NULL. Line:19
        - Make the right child node point to the left child node in the next of the parent node. Line:20
    3. Perform DFS/recursive about the left and right nodes of the current node. Line:22,23

# 복잡도
Time: O(N)<br>
Visited each node at once. So, it affected the number of nodes.
