## 278. First Bad Version (Easy) 
[https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/)

> You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.<br>
Suppose you have n versions`[1, 2, ..., n]`and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.<br>
You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

 I used binary search to implement my solution. This is because the given/aforementioned version array is sorted in ascending order.<br>
 In this problem, since there are only 4 possible cases to happen, I propose the following solution to identify and solve each case.<br>

> **Information:** <br>
If targetVersion is a bad version (isBadVersion(targetVersion) = True),<br>
we don't need to check the right node because the values stored in/at right node are all True.<br>
On the contrary, If targetVersion is not a bad version (isBadVersion(targetVersion) = False).<br>
we don't need to search in left node because the values in left node are all False.<br>

<pre>
case 1.
	targetVersion is True and the one before targetVersion is True
case 2.
	targetVersion is True and before targetVersion is False
case 3.
	targetVersion is False and the next one is False
case 4.
	targetVersion is False and next version is True
</pre>

So/Therefore, if we find the case 2 or 4, we can find/identify the earliest occurrence of False.

# 코드설명
<pre>
1) choose the middle version / choose the number in the middle of the version array.
2) check if the middle version is bad version
	if ) true
		check before version is bad version
			if) true (case 1)
				move the “lastVersion”pointer to the left by one
			if) false (case 2)
				return the middle version
	if) false
		check if the next version is bad version
			if ) true (case 4)
				return the next version
			if ) false (case 3)
				move the “firstVersion”pointer to next version
3) loop 1) ~ 2)
</pre>

# 복잡도
Time : O(log N)<br>
